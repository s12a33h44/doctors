            <h1>COVID WARRIORS</h1>
            <p>The corona warriors are the real hero or our country the pride of our nation. In this time of crisis they are standing strong as the front line commandos to protect us from this dangerous virus by managing traffic, keeping city clean and giving them medical help.<br><br>
                If co-operation to combat this disease is provided then the role of Corona warrior becomes much easier. Corona warriors are working day and night to eradicate the epidemic. despite the virus being so terrible, they are fighting to serve the war.Doctors are not only risking themselves to save the lives of more people, and some have given up their lives in this war while performing their duties.<br><br>
                It is very sad to know that in some areas doctors are being attacked by the people. We should welcome them and say thanks for bravery instead of losing our mind in a fit of rage. A big salute and utmost gratitude to all the corona warriors for standing strong and protecting us against the virus.</p>
